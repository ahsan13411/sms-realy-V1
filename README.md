## 👤 Credits & Intelligence
- **Lead Operator:** [AHSAN](https://github.com/ahsan13411)
- **Central Intelligence:** [AH4 Team](https://github.com/ahsan13411/AH4-SMS-boomer)
- **Sector:** **Network Infiltration & Protocol Research**

---

## 🚀 Advanced Infiltration Capabilities

- **35+ API Node Relays:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in BTCL, Grameenphone, and diverse healthcare/e-commerce gateways.
- **Dynamic Protocol Execution:**
  - **👻 GHOST MODE:** Stealthy, sequential packet delivery designed to bypass basic firewall detection.
  - **🌪️ CHAOS FLOOD:** Advanced asynchronous wave injection with **Micro-Jitter** and **Task Shuffling** for maximum WAF confusion.
- **📡 Auto-Scrape Harvest:** Integrated global proxy harvester fetching thousands of fresh SOCKS4, SOCKS5, and HTTP IPs in real-time.
- **🔍 Node Telemetry:** Automatically extracts carrier metadata, geographical region, and timezone of the target node.
- **📱 Device Spoofing Engine:** Rotates through a pool of 500+ unique User-Agents and spoofed IP headers (X-Forwarded-For).
- **🛡️ Resilience Protocols:** Self-healing core that automatically restarts on socket failures and handles SIGINT/SIGTSTP signals.

## 🛠️ Deployment Instructions

### 📥 Protocol Initialization
```bash
# Clone the encrypted repository
git clone https://github.com/ahsan13411/AH4-SMS-boomer.git
cd AH4-SMS-boomer

# Install sub-module dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### ⚡ System Execution
```bash
python AH4-sms-boomer.py
```

---

## 🎯 Operational Parameters
1. **Selection:** Choose between **GHOST** (Stealth) or **CHAOS** (Flood) protocols.
2. **Proxy Config:**
   - **[1]** Direct IP (Expose Node)
   - **[2]** Local Proxy (Load `proxies.txt`)
   - **[3]** Global Harvest (Auto-fetch thousands of nodes)
3. **Targeting:** Enter the target node's address (Phone number).
4. **Impact:** Monitor the real-time breach statistics and infiltration logs.

---

## 🧬 Node Telemetry [System Info]
The tool extracts and displays local machine vitals during initialization:
- **Timestamp:** Network Time Protocol sync.
- **Node ID:** Hostname and IP identifiers.
- **Hardware:** MAC Address and CPU Architecture.
- **Kernel:** Operating system and build version.

---

## ⚠️ Tactical Warning (Mandatory Reading)
**THIS INFRASTRUCTURE IS FOR EDUCATIONAL AND AUTHORIZED NETWORK RESEARCH ONLY.**

The **AH4 Team** providing this system assumes **zero responsibility** for unauthorized deployment or malicious intent. Use this tool with caution.
- **Do not** use this for illegal harassment.
- **Do not** use this to violate global privacy laws.
- **Do not** get caught.

---

## 🚨 Protocol Recovery
If the system experiences a handshake failure:
- **SSL Issues:** `pip install --upgrade certifi urllib3`
- **Socket Latency:** `pip install -U aiohttp async-timeout`
